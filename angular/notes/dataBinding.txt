Data Binding:
    Every Component In Angular contains 4 files
    component-name.component.html : it is used for the view of component and it is also called Template files
    component-name.component.css : it is used for the style/design of the component and it is also called style file.
    component-name.component.ts : it is used for logic of the component and it is also called component file
    component-name.component.spec.ts : These specification files are used for unit testing and also called as Testing files
    
    Data Binding Deals with the communication between Template file(html) and component files(ts). They are two types of Data Binding
    i. one way Data Binding: There are different ways where data passes one way between HTML and TS file
       a. Typescript to HTML(component to template):
       string Interpolation: it is used to send data from component file to template file. it will keep the dynamic values/expression within double braces {{}}

          //html
          <p>welcome to {{course}} course</p>
          //TS
           course="angular"
        property Binding: it is used to get the dat from component file to template file but unlike string Interpolation, it will not convert every data as a string
         In property Binding, we use square brackets for properties
       b. HTML to Typescript(Template to component):
         Templates can send data/trigger a function using event binding.
         Here events are binded using the parenthesis
         <button (click)="fun()">click me</button>

   ii. Two way Data Binding:
       It is used to send data from Template to component and Receive Data from component to Template At a time. It is possible using a directive "ngModel"
       ngModel will come along with formsModule, so we need to import formsModule into 
       module file
       //html
       <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="n" />

       //ts
       n:string = '';
