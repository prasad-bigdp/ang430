Directives:
Directives are used to manipulate the DOM. There are three types of Directives in angular such as
   i. control Directives (or) conditional Directives:
        These directives are used to control the flow of angular using the condition. Based on Condition, it will change the flow of execution
        eg: ngIf,ngSwitch,ngFor
    ii. property Directives : These Directives are used to manipulate the attribute such as style of class of an element
         eg: ngClass,ngStyle
    iii. custom Directives : These directives are created by developer using ng generate commands


i. control Directives:
   a. ngIf : ngIf is a structural or control directive which is used to show or hide different elements based on the condition
     simple ngIf:
     <element *ngIf="condition">
           //statements
     </element>

    b. ngSwitch : ngSwitch is used to check a value between multiple options. you can use it as a substitute of "if-else-if"
     <div [ngSwitch]="day">
         <p *ngSwitchCase="0">Monday</p>
         <p *ngSwitchCase="1">Tuesday</p>
         <p *ngSwitchCase="2">Wednesday</p>
         <p *ngSwitchCase="3">Thursday</p>
         <p *ngSwitchCase="4">Friday</p>
         <p *ngSwitchCase="5">saturday</p>
         <p *ngSwitchCase="6">Sunday</p>
         <p *ngDefaultCase>Please enter values between 0-6</p>
     </div>

     //ts
     day=5;
  c. ngFor:
      ngFor is used to iterate certain statements until the array is ended
      <div *ngFor="let f of flowers;let i=index">
         <h1>{{f.name}},{{i}}</h1>
         <p>{{f.color}}</p>
      </div>
      //ts
      flowers = [{name:"rose",color:"red"},{name:"lilly",color:"white"}]

ii. property Directives: These directives are used to manipulate the properties of elements such as ngClass and ngStyle

  ngClass : we can set a class name to an element based on a condition so that its DOM can be manipulated
  html
  <p [ngClass]='isGood?'dark':'light'>hello world</p>
  //ts
  isGood=false

  ngStyle : we can set a style value to an element based on a condition so that its Dom values can be manipulated
  html
  <p [ngStyle]="backgroundColor:isRed?'red':'blue'">hello world</p>
  //ts
  isRed= false
