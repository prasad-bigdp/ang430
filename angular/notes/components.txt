Components are the building blocks of User Interface. we divide the whole UI layout into reusable blocks of code called components.
To generate New Component, we use "ng generate component component-name"
Every component will have 4 files
  html(template) -- used for view
  css(style) -- used for styling/design
  ts(component) -- used for logic/control
  spec.ts(test) -- used for testing

Every component will have a name in component file(ts) as "selector". it can be used as html Element

one component can be inside anothe component called nested components
