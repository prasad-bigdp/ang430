Services:Services in angular are used to share the common Data. it provides communication between two unrelated components.
In angular, service is a class that encapsulates some functionalities that can used throught out application
Mainly services are used for 
   i. sharing the Data
   ii. Encasuplating the complex logic
   iii. requesting or handling the API's.

To use services, we need to inject the service. 
 creating a service :
    ng generate service service-name
    it generated two files service.ts and service.spec.ts(testing)
    service.ts contains a class that can be injectable into any component.

Dependency Injection: it is a design pattern that allows components to be loosly coupled so that it is easy to test, maintain and extend the system. it is a technique where one component receives another component that it need to be functioned instead of creating Dependency
