Services:Services in angular are used to share the common Data. it provides communication between two unrelated components.
In angular, service is a class that encapsulates some functionalities that can used throught out application
Mainly services are used for 
   i. sharing the Data
   ii. Encasuplating the complex logic
   iii. requesting or handling the API's.

To use services, we need to inject the service. 
 creating a service :
    ng generate service service-name
    it generated two files service.ts and service.spec.ts(testing)
    service.ts contains a class that can be injectable into any component.

Dependency Injection: it is a design pattern that allows components to be loosly coupled so that it is easy to test, maintain and extend the system. it is a technique where one component receives another component that it need to be functioned instead of creating Dependency

HttpClient:HttpClient is a service provided by angular , used for http requests such as GET,POST,PUT,DELETE, PATCH etc..,
it offers simple API communication and its methods returns observables

How to use HttpClient ?
  step 1: import HttpClientModule in app.module.ts and mention in imports or 
          import provideHttpClient in app.module.ts and call in providers
  step 2: Inject the HttpClient in component or service
  constructor(public obj-name:HttpClient)
  Now this object can be used to call get, post, put,delete methods

   To handle its response observables need to be subscribed.


Observable: Observables are used to handle multiple asynchoronous data like data streams  . it allows you to observe the data changes over time and react to it
Observable vs Promises
Observables used for stream of asynchoronous functionalities but promise is used for single asynchoronous functionality
Observables are usally returned by HttpClient methods and promises are returned by fetch
Observable need to be subscribed and success or fail data will be passed
Promise can be handle using then, catch or async await
