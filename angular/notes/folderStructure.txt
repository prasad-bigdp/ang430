//Day 2:
Folder structure:
By Default Angular App contains some folders and files as below:
  tsconfig.spec.json --> tsconfig files are used to set rules for TSC(Typescript compiler). Testing for those rules are under tsconfig.spec.json
  tsconfig.json --> used to set rules for whole applications
  tsconfig.app.json --> used to rules for only one application
  readme.md --> it is an instruction file, used to instruct users
  package.json --> it contains the meta of application such as app name, author name, version, scripts, packages 
  package-lock.json --> it contains in detailed meta data about  package.json and all the packages installed in node modules
  angular.json --> it contains the settings and actual starting point of angular application
  .gitignore --> it contains list of files and folder which git will ignore
  .editorconfig --> it combines code for different editors

  initially angular get bootstrapped in browser (converting static DOM into Dynamic DOM)
   index.html --> it is the main HTML page that gets loaded from angular.json. it contain 
   <app-root></app-root>
   main.ts --> it is the main ts page that gets loaded from angular.json and it will bootstrapped the browser
